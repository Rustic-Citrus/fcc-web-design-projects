# Responsive Web Design Projects

**Author**: Harry Stuart Curtis

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find my completed projects as assigned by the Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp. All work is my own. As I have used these projects to practice applying my understanding of HTML and CSS, a gradual improvement in the quality of my work should appear across the projects (hopefully).

If you are looking to learn web design, I highly recommend the freeCodeCamp course. Upon completion, you receive a free certification, and you can add the projects you create to your portfolio (as I am doing now).
